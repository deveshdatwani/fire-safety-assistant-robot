# Fire safety assistant robot

<h3> This repository is to showcase my capstone exprience for Fall 2022 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute under Prof Loris Fichera. </h3>

The projcet base was define to build a robot for assisting fire fighting. For build on to this, extensive stakeholder research was carried out to identify a problem statement that has solutions in the Robotics domain.

### Stakeholder Research

Several stakeholders were engaged from different backgrounds. Worcester Fire Department & WPI Fire Safety department remained the primary and most prominent stakeholders. 

Engaging with them was extremely enlightening. I learned a great deal about fire fighting scenarious and the challenges that pertain to them. 

Identifying problem statement was the most challenging part as the stakeholders couldn't guide my team and I with finding problems that can be solved by a robot. In the Fire Department Chief's own words, "thinking out of the box" was not something they could do. Hence the onus of identifying challenges that can be solved by robots, was entirely on me and the team. 

Below our are snapshots from our engagement with the Fire Chief and pictures of the Professors we reached out to for problem statement identification.
